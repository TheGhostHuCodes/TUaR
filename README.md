# Terraform: Up & Running

My workspace containing code listings from the book ["Terraform: Up &
Running"](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/), by Yevgeniy Brikman.

Before deploying any terraform code, be sure to export an environment variable
with the name of the AWS profile that will be used to deploy infrastructure.

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE="AWS profile name"
```
